# Overview

This tutorial will take you through building your first IBC application with [yui-ibc-solidity](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/yui-ibc-solidity).
We will create a smart contract that allows us to transfer tokens between two ledgers using IBC.

You will learn how to
- Use IBC to create and send packets between blockchains.
- Create a basic token and send tokens to another blockchain.

Here, we will use Solidity to describe the smart contract.
The following ledgers are used:
- Hyperledger Besu
- Ethereum

If you want to know more about IBC, please refer to

Also, the solidity implementation of IBC is
